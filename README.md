# Workplace Checker

Checks if someones employer is legitimate and returns possible company URL.
I Gemini is pretty bad but FREE of charge so I'm using it.
Just make a cool little .env file and do this:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Then run the main.py file for FREE ROBUX. (I'm not responsible for any damages that may occur)
