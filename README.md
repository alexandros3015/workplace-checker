Gemini is pretty bad but FREE of charge so I'm using it.
Just make a cool little .env file and do this:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
## Requirements
Hit that `pip install google-generativeai`  
Oh yeah and also `pip install google`

Then run the main.py file for FREE ROBUX. (I'm not responsible for any damages that may occur)
